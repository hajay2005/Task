Setup and Execution Guide for Blockchain Simulation

1. Prerequisites
Before running the blockchain simulation, ensure you have the following installed:

For Python Implementation
âœ… Python 3.x (Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/))  
âœ… A terminal or command prompt  
âœ… A text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, or any other)
 
For JavaScript Implementation
âœ… Node.js installed (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/))  
âœ… A terminal or command prompt  
âœ… A text editor (VS Code or any other)

2. Clone or Download the Repository
Once you've uploaded your code to GitHub, you (or anyone else) can **clone** the repository.

Cloning the Repo (Command Line)
Open a terminal and run:
bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-simulation.git
cd blockchain-simulation


Or, download the repository as a **ZIP file** from GitHub and extract it.

3. Install Dependencies (if needed)
This simulation primarily uses **Python's standard libraries**, so no extra dependencies are needed. However, if your implementation includes additional libraries:

For Python
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

*(Only required if your project uses external libraries.)*

For JavaScript
Navigate to the project folder and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
*(Only required if using external npm packages.)*

4. Run the Blockchain Simulation
For Python
Run the script using:
```bash
python blockchain.py
```
For JavaScript
If using Node.js:
```bash
node blockchain.js
```

---
5. Expected Output
The program will:
âœ… Print the blockchain with all blocks.  
âœ… Validate the integrity of the blockchain.  
âœ… Demonstrate what happens when someone tries to tamper with the data.  
âœ… (Optional) Show Proof-of-Work in action if implemented.  

6. Tampering Demonstration
To test blockchain security:
- Modify a block manually in the code.
- Run the validation function.
- The blockchain should detect tampering and return `False`.

---

7. Proof-of-Work (Optional)
If you implemented Proof-of-Work:
- The script will "mine" a block by repeatedly hashing until it meets the difficulty condition (e.g., hash starting with `0000`).
- You will see **mining time increase** as difficulty increases.

8. Submitting Your Project
1. Push the code to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Blockchain simulation completed"
   git push origin main
   ```
2. Make sure you have a **README.md** explaining:
   - How to install and run the script.
   - Example outputs.
   - Features (block creation, validation, tampering detection, Proof-of-Work).
3. Submit your **GitHub repository link** via the provided Google Form.

9. Troubleshooting
ðŸ’¡ If you get **Python not found** â†’ Install Python and check PATH settings.  
ðŸ’¡ If you get **ModuleNotFoundError** â†’ Check if you need any missing dependencies.  
ðŸ’¡ If hashing or validation fails â†’ Debug by printing block hashes and previous hash values.
